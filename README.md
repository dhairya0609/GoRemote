# 🔐 GoRemote: Secure & Scalable Remote Code Execution Platform

GoRemote is a secure, scalable, and resilient platform for remote code execution, specializing in **Go language** support. It provides **low-latency**, **isolated**, and **malware-resistant** execution environments powered by Docker, MongoDB, and semantic OWL reasoning. Designed for high availability and real-time monitoring, GoRemote is built to handle large-scale, concurrent workloads safely.

## 🎯 Overview

**GoRemote** provides:
- 🚀 Fast and secure execution of Go code
- 🐳 Docker-based isolation for each user
- 🧠 Malware detection via OWL-based reasoning engine
- ⚖️ Smart request distribution using nginx load balancer
- 💾 Persistent storage of user, code, and logs in MongoDB
- ♻️ Auto-removal of idle containers to optimize performance

---

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication**: Register/Login/Logout using JWT & password hashing.
- **Code Management**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete Go code snippets.
- **Secure Execution**: Dockerized containers per user ensure safe, isolated execution.
- **Malware Detection**: Python-based OWL engine flags malicious code before execution.
- **Load Balancing**: nginx routes requests to Go/Rust servers in round-robin fashion.
- **Auto Cleanup**: Docker containers are stopped after 10 minutes of inactivity.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions and outputs are logged and stored.

## 🛠️ Architecture

```
Client → Authorization (JWT) → Ontology Check (OWL)
     → nginx Load Balancer → Go/Rust Execution Servers (Docker)
     → MongoDB for Code, Logs, Users
```

- **Router VM**: nginx + Reverse Proxy + Resource Allocator
- **Execution VMs**: Go & Rust servers running code in Docker containers
- **Ontology Module**: Detects malicious code using OWL semantic analysis
- **Database VM**: MongoDB for persistent storage

---

## 🧱 Components

### 1. 🔐 Authorization Module
- Handles user registration, login, logout
- Stores hashed credentials and session tokens in MongoDB

### 2. 🧠 Ontology Module
- Uses OWL (Web Ontology Language) + rule engine
- Detects suspicious or malicious code patterns

### 3. 🌐 Router VM
- nginx handles load balancing and reverse proxying
- Routes to least-burdened execution server

### 4. 🧪 Execution VMs
- Docker containers per user
- Reuses containers for better performance
- Executes Go code (Rust server also present for future scaling)

### 5. 💾 MongoDB
- Stores users, sessions, code, execution logs, and output

## 📜 Algorithms & Flow

### 🔁 Main Flow
```
Start → Listen for Request → Process_Request(Request)
```

### 🔐 Process_Request(Request)
```pseudo
Input: user_token, code
→ Authorize_User(user_token)
  → If fail, return "Authorization Failed"
→ Malicious_Code_Check(code)
  → If malicious, return "Malicious Code Detected"
→ Route_To_Execution_Server(user_id, code)
  → Execute code in container
→ Return code output to client
```

### ⚖️ Route_To_Execution_Server
```pseudo
→ nginx selects least-loaded server
→ Create or reuse Docker container
→ Copy code and execute inside container
→ Capture and return output
```

### 📝 Update_MongoDB
```pseudo
→ Save user_id, file_path, code, output, logs to MongoDB
```
